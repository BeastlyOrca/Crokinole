ideas: array of background soundtracks (use royal)

for shooting area if can't figure, use planes to block off instead 

1-50 single player levels where the objective is to either get a certain score or clear pieces off of the table


for shooting area, current idea is two cubes or planes, see if can combine into one object and use their area like the bullseye code to determine if allowed to shoot
